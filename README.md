### Summary

I built this application to get more experience using React. As this was the second application that I have built using React, I found that I was able to use the unique features of React, such as state and props, much more easily and proficiently than in my first React application.

Moreover, in creating this application, I experimented with and learned how to create a modal component using React. I also was able to practice using Bootstrap more in styling this application. Again, because this was my second application using Bootstrap for styling, I was more comfortable in its execution. In regards to Bootstrap, I became much more comfortable using and navigating the Boostrap documentation to implement the desired styling.
